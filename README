YFKtest Version 0.0.10 - Ham Radio Contest logger by Fabian Kurz, DJ1YFK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Project description
-----------------------

YFKtest is a logbook program for ham radio contests [1]. It supports many
popular contests and is easily extendable to log and score arbitrary contests.
[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contesting

See docs/MANUAL for a short description of the basic functionalities and keys.
See docs/HOW-TO for a step by step install guide for using with Ubuntu (10.10).

2. Project website
------------------
The latest version can be found at: http://fkurz.net/ham/yfktest.html

3. System requirements
----------------------
YFKtest is developed and tested under Debian Etch and FreeBSD 5. It's
programmed in Perl 5 and requires the following modules:

- strict
- Curses
- IO::Socket::INET

Optional: cwdaemon or winkeydaemon.pl, Hamlib

IO::Socket::Inet, and possibly Curses, might not be a part of your standard
distribution of Perl. These should be available through your system's package
manager (Debian: libcurses-perl and Ubuntu info can be found here in the
docs/ARRL-FD-HOW-TO.txt file.)

yfktest was designed to run in a console window with 80x24 characters.

5. Installation
---------------
If you are reading this after downloading the files that is all the
installation that is recommended. You simply run the program from the directory
you downloaded to.

See docs/ARRL-FD-HOW-TO.txt for instructions on setting up and using yfktest
with Ubuntu Linux. Version 10.10 has been tested. Later versions should work
as well and mostly earlier versions that are not too old.

NOTE: *** Installation with the makefile in misc/ is not needed and certainly
not recommended for personal use. (i.e. None of the contributors are running the
makefile install ! .... Using yfktest with such "packaging" has not been
tested on the latest svn code as a result. See docs/INSTALL and the misc/
directory for more info if you just gotta try a "makefile install".)

6. Future plans
---------------
Addition of (all) popular HF contests. Networking. DX cluster + Bandmap.

Please see the docs/TODO file if you would like to contribute to any ongoing
work.
