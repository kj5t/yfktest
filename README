YFKtest Version 0.0.10 - Ham Radio Contest logger by Fabian Kurz, DJ1YFK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Project description
-----------------------

YFKtest is a logbook program for ham radio contests [1]. It supports many
popular contests and is easily extendable to log and score arbitrary contests.

See docs/MANUAL for a short description of the basic functionalities and keys.
See docs/HOW-TO for a step by step install guide for using with Ubuntu (10.10).

2. Project website
------------------
The latest version can be found at: http://fkurz.net/ham/yfktest.html

3. System requirements
----------------------
YFKtest is developed and tested under Debian Etch and FreeBSD 5. It's
programmed in Perl 5 and requires the following modules:

- strict
- Curses
- IO::Socket::INET

Optional: cwdaemon or winkeydaemon.pl, Hamlib

Inet, and possibly Curses, might not be a part of your standard distribution of
Perl. These should be available through your system's package manager (Debian:
libcurses-perl).

yfktest was designed to run in a console window with 80x24 characters.

5. Installation
---------------
If you are reading this after downloading the files that is all the
installation that is recommended. Installation with a make file is not needed
or recommended for personal use.

See docs/HOW-TO for Ubuntu installation instructions. Version 10.10 is tested.
Later versions should work as well.

(See docs/INSTALL and misc/ for more info if you just gotta try an "install".)

6. Future plans
---------------
Addition of (all) popular HF contests. Networking. DX cluster + Bandmap.
