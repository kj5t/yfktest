YFKtest TODO list (feel free to add things!)
--------------------------------------------

As of 19-24 June 2011 - w9ya
	- Add some sort of ability to select different sized sub-windows AND
	  color schemes. Possibly defaults and selection from either the defs
	  files and/or the ~/.yfktest file.
	- Find a working solution (i.e. easily added in) for adding at least
	  two outgoing exchange fields. OR at the very least find a way to
	  include a space in the one outgoing exchange field during the contest
	  setup dialog.
	- ALT-K now works w/ winkey too - but no "zero" output.
	- Add a CwOps/CWT defs.
	- Work on the HOW-TO stuff....currently called ARRL-FD-HOW-TO. i.e.
	  Try to make it more generic, or at least less kludgy.
	- Is there an adif generation issue ? i.e. Noted that the exchange
	  field is always 5NN. Is this correct for some silly reason ?
	- Create a method to setup and initilize the keyer with options from
	  inside of yfktest.
	- Allow choice of cwdaemon/winkeydaemon as runtime/configfile/ or ??
		(Is cwdaemon still "current" and/or usable ???)
		*** Note: winkeyer ONLY seems to take upppercase characters.
