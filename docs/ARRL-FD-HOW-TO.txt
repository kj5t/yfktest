Simple HOW-TO for using YFKTEST for logging the ARRL Field Day Contest:
		de Bob, w9ya		June 2011


Installing under Ubuntu 10.10 (or 11.04 using the "classic"(gnome) login);
	- Make sure you have “subversion” installed, via the (Alt+F1, System,
		Administration,) Synaptic Package Manager.
	- IF you want to use the winkeyer interface you will need to also
		install this package;
                	libio-socket-inet6-perl
	- Open up a terminal by;
                typing Ctrl+Alt+t (the plus symbol means you press all of the
			keys the same time)
        - Set aside a place to get to and use your program. I suggest invoking
		this;
                	mkdir /~/logging/yfktest/ <enter>
				(do NOT type out ‘enter’, rather press that key)
		and then;
                	cd /~/logging/yfktest/ <enter>
		finally this;
          svn checkout svn://dl0tud.tu-dresden.de/yfk/yfktest/trunk <enter>
        

Preparing for use;
	- Initialize your config file;
                cat << EOF >> /~/.yfktest
                        at the ‘>’ prompt type; (substituting your call for
					NB0ZOS)
                                mycall=NB0ZOS <enter>
                                EOF <enter>
        - Open up the terminal again (Ctrl+Alt+t) and configure it;
          	from the menu-bar using Edit, Keyboard Shortcuts, making sure
	  	that you change any shortcuts that use F1 through F7, F11, and
	  	any of the Alt-key sequences that yfktest’s internal help page
	  	calls out. (More on the help page below.)
        - It’s important to make sure the terminal is showing 24x80 mode. This
		can be set from the Terminal section of the menu-bar's
		selections. 


Testing and Preparing your Winkeyer and the interface;
	- Your Winkeyer can be either a USB-Winkeyer OR a Serial-Winkreyer
		augmented with a USB-to-serial-cable.
			(These cables work Great in Linux !!)
	- I *strongly* suggest using “WkDemo”, available as a download from
		K1EL’s website, to configure your winkeyer. To run this you
		will need to install ‘Wine’.
        - Install ‘Wine’ using the Synaptic Package Manager. Same way you did
		above to install the inet6-perl module and subversion.
        - To allow ‘Wine’ to communicate with your USB connected Winkeyer be
		sure to (again inside a terminal window i.e. Ctrl+Alt+t);
                	cd ~/.wine/dosdevices/ <enter>
                	sudo ln -s /dev/ttyUSB0 com1 <enter>
                ** (Of course if you are using a serial interface then use;
			/dev/ttyS0 instead !)
        - Use WkDemo to setup your Winkeyer settings. I have found this to
		work well even with my VERY old winkeyer (V3 pcb with a V10
		chip) and a dirt-cheap ebay special USB-to-Serial converter
		running on /dev/ttyUSB0. WkDemo is directed to use com1 and
		this is driected to the linux kernel drivers using the above
		command.


Running yfktest;
        - Be sure you are in the right place;
                Make sure your terminal is (still) opened up. If not then type
				Ctrl+Alt+t,
			then type;
                                cd /~/logging/yfktest/ <enter>
        - The invocation to run the program is;
                ./yfktest-ARRL-FD <enter>
                        - The first time through you will have to select the
				ARRL-FD template from the window and fill it
				out using the arrow keys and the <enter> key.
            	- Next time through invoke this to select the contest file;
                	./yfktest-ARRL-FD ARRL-FD.yfk <enter>
	- Play around a bit. Logging is simple with these 6 simple rules;
		- The <tab> key will bring you to the callsign entry “window”
		- The <space> bar/key will toggle through the 3 input “windows”
		- The <enter> key will log the completed contact
		- Alt+H brings up the help screen
		- If things jam up (like trying to use Alt+K/keyboard CW mode;
			use Alt+W to erase the current exchange/callsign info
		- If things jam up badly, you can always hit Ctrl+C to force
			the program to quit


Helpful suggestions;
        - To streamline things, you can avoid repeating ALL of the starting
		questions concerning the rig-control and keyer interface by
		creating “dummy” files like this example; 
			touch rigctld.sh <enter> 
				AND/OR 
			touch winkeydaemon.sh <enter>
                (These two files -fools- the program into using no
			rig control and/or winkeyer interface without
                        having to declare that you are not using these
			interface(s) each time you run the program !)
	- To re-invoke the program after using QUIT, you can use the <up-arrow>
		key to scroll back through your previous terminal commands.
        - I *strongly* suggest using an ascii text editor (my favorite is
		‘nano’) to add a space to separate the class and section keying
		output. This is on line number 10 of the following file.
			Invoke editing like this;
                        	nano -w ARRL.yfk <enter>
                                	(then scroll down to line number 10.)
